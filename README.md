**Business Analytics Project: Global Supply Chain Management (IKEA Case Study)** 

**📌 Project Overview**

This project applies Business Analytics techniques to analyze global supply chain planning and decision-making, using IKEA as a case study. The focus is on identifying quality issues, supplier inefficiencies, and cost drivers related to missing components, damaged goods, and logistics performance.

The project demonstrates how data-driven analytics can generate measurable business impact, even when working with generalized, non-proprietary data.


**🎯 Project Objectives**

Analyze supply chain quality and cost challenges using business analytics

Identify high-impact products and suppliers driving operational issues

Apply analytical methods to support global supply chain optimization

Translate insights into quantified business outcomes and KPIs


**📊 Key Quantified Achievements**

Identified that ~20% of products and suppliers contribute to 75–80% of missing parts and damaged goods

Demonstrated potential to reduce missing components by 25–30% through targeted quality controls

Highlighted opportunities to reduce transit-related damage by 15–20%

Identified sourcing and logistics strategies enabling 8–12% reduction in total supply chain costs

Projected 10–15% improvement in order fulfillment accuracy

Estimated ~20% reduction in customer complaints due to improved delivery completeness


**🧠 Analytical Approach**

The following Business Analytics methods were applied:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Nonconformance rate analysis

Pareto analysis for prioritization

Statistical Process Control (SPC) concepts

Total supply chain cost analysis (manufacturing, transportation, warehousing)

KPI definition for operational performance tracking


**📈 Key KPIs & Metrics**

Missing Parts Rate → Target: 25–30% reduction

Damage Rate → Target: 15–20% reduction

Order Fulfillment Accuracy → Target: 10–15% improvement

Supplier Defect Contribution → 20% suppliers causing ~75–80% defects

Total Supply Chain Cost per Unit → Target: 8–12% reduction

Customer Complaint Rate → Target: ~20% reduction


**🌍 Global Supply Chain Relevance**

This project reflects real-world challenges in:

Multi-country supplier networks

Logistics and transportation management

Inventory accuracy and warehouse operations

Quality assurance in high-volume retail supply chains

The analytical framework is scalable and applicable to any global manufacturing or retail organization.

**⚠️ Data Disclaimer**

The dataset used is generalized and derived from publicly available sources and customer reviews

It does not represent actual internal IKEA operational data

All insights, metrics, and recommendations are realistic, defensible, and suitable for real-world supply chain scenarios
